This will be a startup guide of how to use the program. Read through and follow the steps to get started with the program and understand how to use it correctly

# Once you have your server running
Once your server is running, navigate to 'localhost:5000' in your preferred web browser.
You should see a button marked 'Choose File', click this and navigate to the .gpx file that you want to convert into a cue sheet. Select it, and click open.
If you have completed this step correctly, you should now see the title of your chosen file next to the Choose File button(as opposed to 'No file chosen').
Assuming you see your file, click submit when you are ready to create your cue sheet.
After a brief processing time, you will be presented with your cue sheet. Currently there is no way to download the instructions, so you will have to manually copy and 
paste them to a file of your choosing.

# Known issues/limitations

### Unkown paths/roads
Our application is powered by Google. A result of this is if Google doesn't recognize a path/road taken in the track, 
the outputted cue sheet results will vary and cannot be guaranteed as accurate.

### Designed for bicyclists
While this application will probably also work for driving, and somewhat for running/walking in urban areas, bicyclists are the target demographic.

### Input/Output is not always 1 to 1
In some cases, such as U-Turns, Google will output slightly different instructions/distances for U-turns. This means if a gpx file is ran multiple times
the route overall will be the same, but small details could vary.
